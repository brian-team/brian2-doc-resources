This repository contains automatically generated files for the Brian 2
documentation.

**Please do not change files in this repository directly, and do not
open pull requests against this repository.**

This repository is used as a submodule in the main Brian 2 repository so
that its documentation can be displayed on http://brian2.readthedocs.org,
without storing big image files directly in the main repository.

The files stored in this repository are:

* Figures generated by examples (folder `example_images`). To make
  changes, change the respective example script directly in the
  `examples` folder of the brian-team/brian2 repository. To update the
  images in this repository, run the `dev/tools/run_examples.py` script
  (in the brian-team/brian2 repository).
* Jupyter notebooks for the tutorials that have been executed, i.e.
  with images stored as part of the notebook, as well as restructured
  text versions of these notebooks with the images stored as separate
  files (all in the `tutorials` folder). To make changes to these
  tutorials, edit the `.ipynb` files in the `tutorials` folder of the
  brian-team/brian2 repository. Note that the files commited there
  should be cleared of all output before commiting them. Then run the
  `dev/tools/docs/build_tutorials.py` script to generate the files for
  this repository.
