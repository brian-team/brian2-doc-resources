Tutorials
=========

The tutorial consists of a series of `Jupyter Notebooks`_ [#]_.

.. only:: html

    You can quickly view these using the first links below. To use them interactively - allowing you
    to edit and run the code - there are two options. The easiest option is to click
    on the "Launch Binder" link, which will open up an interactive version in the
    browser without having to install Brian locally. This uses the
    Binder service provided by the
    `Freeman lab <https://www.janelia.org/lab/freeman-lab>`_. Occasionally, this
    service will be down or running slowly. The other option is to download the
    notebook file and run it locally, which requires you to have Brian installed.

For more information about how to use Jupyter Notebooks, see the
`Jupyter Notebook documentation`_.
